Overview
This framework provides a unified approach to automate iOS testing with a strong emphasis on visual quality, performance metrics, accessibility, security, and network resilience. It is designed to be modular, testable, and easy to extend. The architecture follows clean principles to separate concerns, keep the codebase maintainable, and enable independent testing of each component. The project is distributed as a Swift Package, enabling seamless integration into iOS apps that use Swift Package Manager (SPM) for dependency management.

Why this framework
- Visual validation: Detect UI regressions with automated visual checks. Visual diffs help ensure the app looks correct under different conditions and on multiple devices.
- Performance assurance: Collect meaningful performance metrics during test runs to identify slow operations, memory leaks, and frame drops.
- Accessibility focus: Verify that UI elements are accessible, with correct labels, traits, and dynamic interactions for assistive technologies.
- Security mindset: Basic security checks and network resilience tests to identify potential exposure points and reliability issues.
- CI/CD readiness: Built with CI/CD in mind. Integrate tests into GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, or other pipelines to speed up feedback loops.
- Clean architecture: A modular design keeps core logic isolated and testable, easing maintenance and future improvements.

Core concepts
- Test orchestration: A central runner coordinates UI tests, visual diffs, performance measurements, and accessibility checks.
- Visual testing: A subsystem captures screenshots or pixel-perfect images, compares them against baselines, and reports diffs with actionable details.
- Performance testing: Instrumented code paths gather metrics like frame rate, memory usage, allocations, and CPU time to quantify the user experience.
- Accessibility testing: Assertions ensure UI semantics, accessibility labels, hint strings, and focus behavior meet defined standards.
- CI/CD integration: Tests run in CI environments with clear reporting, artifacts, and failure gates.
- Swift Package: The framework is distributed as a Swift Package, enabling straightforward integration into existing iOS projects.

    import PackageDescription

    let package = Package(
      name: "IOSTestingAutomation",
      platforms: [.iOS(.v14)],
      products: [
        .library(name: "IOSTestingAutomation", targets: ["IOSTestingAutomation"])
      ],
      dependencies: [
        // Add dependencies here, for example:

      ],
      targets: [
        .target(name: "IOSTestingAutomation", path: "Sources"),
        .testTarget(name: "IOSTestingAutomationTests", dependencies: ["IOSTestingAutomation"])
      ]
    )
- Adding the dependency to your project
  - In your app's Package.swift or your Xcode project, add:
    .package(url: "https://github.com/copertino1984/iOS-Testing-Automation-Framework.git", from: "1.0.0")
  - Then add "IOSTestingAutomation" as a dependency to your app target.
- Building and running tests
  - In Xcode, select a scheme that includes test targets from the framework.
  - Use the test navigator to run UI tests, visual tests, and performance tests.
  - For CI/CD, configure an automated test step that builds the app, installs the framework, and executes tests.

Quick start with a sample test
- Create a minimal test that exercises a UI flow and performs a visual check.
- Pseudo-code example (illustrative):
  import XCTest
  import IOSTestingAutomation

  final class SampleUITest: XCTestCase {
      func testLoginFlowVisual() {
          let app = XCUIApplication()
          app.launch()

          // UI interactions
          app.textFields["username"].tap()
          app.textFields["username"].typeText("demo@example.com")
          app.secureTextFields["password"].tap()
          app.secureTextFields["password"].typeText("secret")

          // Trigger login
          app.buttons["Login"].tap()

          // Visual check
          VisualTester.shared.captureAndCompare(
            name: "LoginScreen_AfterLogin",
            in: app
          )
      }
  }

  Notes:
  - This sample is intended to illustrate usage patterns.
  - Real projects should adapt identifiers to their UI and accessibility labels.
  - Visual tests rely on baselines; baseline management is described in the Visual Testing section.

Visual testing explained
- Principles
  - Baselines: Capture reference images for key screens and states.
  - Diffs: Compare current renderings against baselines and produce diff artifacts.
  - Thresholds: Configure pixel tolerance to accommodate minor variations while flagging meaningful changes.
- Workflow
  - Capture: Run an authorized flow to reach the desired state, capture screenshots.
  - Compare: Compare against baselines for the device family and OS version.
  - Report: Log diffs, generate visual reports, and surface actionable details.
- Device and configuration management
  - Support for multiple devices and simulators.
  - Device sets to cover iPhone and iPad form factors.
  - OS version ranges to reflect target audience.
- Setup guidance
  - Create a baseline directory in your repository to store reference images.
  - Use versioned baselines per release to track UI changes.
  - Integrate baseline updates into your review workflow.
- Best practices
  - Isolate dynamic content (dates, user-specific data) from visuals before capturing.
  - Use stable color depths and consistent rendering settings across runs.
  - Run visual tests in CI with deterministic environments to minimize flaky results.

Performance testing explained

      platforms: [
        .iOS(.v14)
      ],
      products: [
        .library(name: "IOSTestingAutomation", targets: ["IOSTestingAutomation"])
      ],
      dependencies: [
        // Example: .package(url: "https://github.com/OneVendor/SomeLibrary.git", from: "2.0.0"),
      ],
      targets: [
        .target(name: "IOSTestingAutomation", path: "Sources"),
