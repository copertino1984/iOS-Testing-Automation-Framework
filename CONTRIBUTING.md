## üìù Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) and [Google Swift Style Guide](https://google.github.io/swift/).

#### Naming Conventions

```swift
// ‚úÖ Good
class TestAutomationFramework {
    func runTest(_ testCase: TestCase) async throws -> TestResult {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// ‚ùå Bad
class testAutomationFramework {
    func run_test(testCase: TestCase) async throws -> TestResult {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

#### Code Organization

```swift
// ‚úÖ Good - Clear organization
class TestAutomationFramework {
    // MARK: - Properties
    private let configuration: TestConfiguration
    private let logger = Logger(label: "TestAutomationFramework")
    
    // MARK: - Initialization
    public init(configuration: TestConfiguration) {
        self.configuration = configuration
        setupLogging()
    }
    
    // MARK: - Public Methods
    public func runTest(_ testCase: TestCase) async throws -> TestResult {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    // MARK: - Private Methods
    private func setupLogging() {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

#### Documentation

```swift
/// Main testing automation framework for iOS applications.
/// Provides comprehensive testing capabilities including UI testing, unit testing, performance testing, and security testing.
@available(iOS 15.0, macOS 12.0, *)
public class TestAutomationFramework {
    
    /// Configuration for the testing framework
    private var configuration: TestAutomationConfiguration
    
    /// Initialize the testing automation framework
    /// - Parameter configuration: Custom configuration for the framework
    public init(configuration: TestAutomationConfiguration) {
        self.configuration = configuration
        setupLogging()
    }
    
    /// Run a single test case
    /// - Parameter testCase: The test case to execute
    /// - Returns: The result of the test execution
    /// - Throws: TestExecutionError if the test fails
    public func runTest(_ testCase: TestCase) async throws -> TestResult {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

```swift
// ‚úÖ Good - Comprehensive error handling
enum TestExecutionError: Error, LocalizedError {
    case timeout(TimeInterval)
    case configurationInvalid(String)
    case testNotFound(String)
    
    var errorDescription: String? {
        switch self {
        case .timeout(let duration):
            return "Test execution timed out after \(duration) seconds"
        case .configurationInvalid(let reason):
            return "Invalid configuration: \(reason)"
        case .testNotFound(let testName):
            return "Test not found: \(testName)"
        }
    }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

```swift
// ‚úÖ Good - Performance optimized
class TestAutomationFramework {
    private let testQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.testing.framework", qos: .userInitiated)
    private let resultCache = NSCache<NSString, TestResult>()
    
    func runTests(_ testCases: [TestCase]) async throws -> [TestResult] {
        return try await withTaskGroup(of: TestResult.self) { group in
            for testCase in testCases {
                group.addTask {
                    return try await self.runTest(testCase)
                }
            }
            
            var results: [TestResult] = []
            for try await result in group {
                results.append(result)
            }
            return results
        }
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import iOSTestingAutomationFramework

@available(iOS 15.0, macOS 12.0, *)
final class TestAutomationFrameworkTests: XCTestCase {
    
    // MARK: - Properties
    var testFramework: TestAutomationFramework!
    var mockConfiguration: MockTestConfiguration!
    
    // MARK: - Setup and Teardown
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        mockConfiguration = MockTestConfiguration()
        testFramework = TestAutomationFramework(configuration: mockConfiguration)
    }
    
    override func tearDown() {
        testFramework = nil
        mockConfiguration = nil
        super.tearDown()
    }
    
    // MARK: - Tests
    func testFrameworkInitialization() async throws {
        // Given
        let config = TestConfiguration()
        config.enableParallelExecution = true
        
        // When
        let framework = TestAutomationFramework(configuration: config)
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertNotNil(framework)
        XCTAssertTrue(framework.configuration.enableParallelExecution)
    }
    
    func testTestSuiteExecution() async throws {
        // Given
        let testSuite = UITestSuite()
        testSuite.addTest(MockUITest())
        
        // When
        let results = try await testFramework.runTests(testSuite)
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertEqual(results.count, 1)
        XCTAssertTrue(results.first?.status == .passed)
    }
}
```

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (80% of tests)

```swift
func testIndividualComponent() {
    // Test individual functions, classes, or methods
    // Fast execution, high coverage
}
```

#### Integration Tests (15% of tests)

```swift
func testComponentInteraction() {
    // Test how components work together
    // Medium execution speed, medium coverage
}
```

#### UI Tests (5% of tests)

```swift
func testUserInterface() {
    // Test complete user flows
    // Slow execution, low coverage
}
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 95% for all new code
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage required
- **Edge Cases**: Must be tested
- **Error Scenarios**: Must be tested

### Performance Tests

```swift
func testPerformance() {
    measure {
        // Code to measure performance
        let result = performExpensiveOperation()
        XCTAssertNotNil(result)
    }
}
```
